      <p class="desc"> Come meet Loki, who is a member of our pet care center!! He loves to play with squeaky toys and take trips to the hardware store. His foster parent has invested in lots of training classes for him so he is a well-behaved dog!
         He needs to be the only pet in the home and needs to have a home without small children.</p>
