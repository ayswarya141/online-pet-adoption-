      <p class="desc"> Charlie is a submissive and gentle dog looking for a home to call all his own. He loves bones , ropes  and other toys  so much that he’s willing to share with his humans and fur friends. Charlie is a couch-lounging pup that likes his daily walks but is not looking for a walk-a-thon .
         He is great with kids of all ages and needs some introduction time to adjust to little ones.</p>
