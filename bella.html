      <p class="desc"> Mother nature is beautiful and caring, just like our sweet Bella. This sweetheart is looking for a family to give her lots of cuddles and take her on sunset walks. She's a gentle giant with lots of love to give!

        Her ideal date night would be a walk around the park, followed by Netflix and cuddles. If that sounds good, you should see her smile! It's the prettiest thing mother nature ever made!!</p>
