      <p class="desc"> Snoopy is a friendly and fun loving doggo in our pet care center. She is fully house trained and wonderful around dogs and kids of all ages, though she can be a bit rambunctious. 
        A family with medium to larger dogs and older kids would be ideal, so Snoopy doesn’t need to rein in her enthusiasm for play time and cuddles! </p>
