      <h2>DORA</h2>
      <h1>FEMALE</h1>
      <h1>1-2 YEARS </h1>
      <h1>BLACK AND WHITE COLOR</h1>
      <p class="desc"> We found her in the middle of the road after being struck by an 18 wheeler. A guardian angel picked her up and took her to the vet and they said she had no broken bones!! The vet also complimented her on her gorgeous David Bowie eyes.

        Dora is a curious girl who always has one ear at attention. She enjoys receiving belly rubs.She is very well trained and obedient but does need to be the only dog in the family.</p>
